# basic-stuff
Most basic parts that I learn in the earliest part of my coding life. Things contained here may not reflect my skills at the moment.
# What we will put inside this repo
I am going to put all the codes that I create for learning purposes. There will be certain simple javascript codes which do very simple things like adding things to a list.
There will also be html and css pages and home pages that I will create to get a feel of coding as a subject and a way of life. 
I can assure anyone that there will be no impressive projects here, I will be putting those in other repositories. But, this might explain my learning process to anyone who is interested in learning how I learned to code.
There will be a lot of Home Pages created with html and css because those are the two languages that I am familiar with at the moment, and there will be some javascript projects.
This is me just following a tutorial and adding a useless branch.
